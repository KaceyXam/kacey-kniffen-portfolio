Over the past week, I have been working on my web design skills. I think my development skills are fairly good, but I have a hard time using figma and designing a site that looks good. The site I decided to design is called Chat Universe.

### What is Chat Universe?

My idea for Chat Universe is that it's a realtime chat app, like Discord, but I themed it around space, since space is cool. The home page has a description of what Chat Universe is and why you should use it, similar to how Discord's home page is. For the Join Room, Create Room, and Sign Up/Sign In pages, I decided to use a similar design where there is a central box with the form. For the Chatroom page, I made a simple chat box, similar to most chat applications.

When designing this I made sure to be thinking about how the mobile site was gonna look. For the mobile home page, I simply lined all the content up into one column, so it's easy to read. For the other pages, I was able to just shrink the frame to be mobile sized.

### How do I think I did?

I think I did pretty decently considering I am not good at using Figma. One thing I did learn how to do was to use auto layout. Auto Layout in Figma is one of the most useful htings I have ever used. Auto Layout lets you work with frames the same way you work with flexbox in CSS, which made things very simple to use. It also makes things easier to convert to actual CSS code, since all the proerties are in Auto Layout.

One thing I didn't do well was project organization. If I was working with someone else on this, I don't think they would be able to understand where anything is. Project organization is something I need to get better at in everything, not just Figma though.

I want to come back to this project in a couple of months to see how much more I could improve it.

### Will I ever actually build Chat Universe?

Probably not, but it really depends on how bored I am. If I ever get really bored, I might build it.
