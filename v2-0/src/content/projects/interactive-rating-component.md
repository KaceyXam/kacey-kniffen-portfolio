## This is my solution to the [interactive rating component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI) challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

This project is one of the [Frontend Mentor]() newbie projects. This was the first frontend mentor project I did. The goal of this project is to recreate a rating component. You can select a rating from 1 to 5 with the number buttons and when you submit your rating, it will take you to a page that shows the score you gave.

### What did I use?

I built this project with just Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I decided not to use a framework, or even use TypeScript, because I wanted to make sure I had a strong understanding of how JavaScript works before jumping into something more advanced, like React.

### What would I do differently?

If I did this project again, I would made sure to use radio buttons and a form instead of regular buttons. That way I wouldn't need to manually check if each button is selected.
