## This is my recreation of the [Fireship.io](https://fireship.io) homepage using Solid Js.

[Fireship](https://www.youtube.com/@Fireship) is a programming YouTuber who mainy focuses on Web Development content. He makes fast paced tutorials on his channel with more in-depth paid courses on his site, Fireship.io.

[Solid.js](https://www.solidjs.com/) is a modern web framework similar to React. Unlike React, Solid has no virtual DOM, meaning when the state of your app changes, the only DOM elements that update are the ones dependant on the changed state.

## Why did I do this?

The Reason I decided to remake Fireship.io with Solid was simply because I wanted to learn more about how Solid works and Fireship.io seemed simple enough to recreate. Also since Fireship made the site open source, if I ran into anything I didn't know how to do, I could just look at [the code on GitHub](https://github.com/fireship-io/fireship.io).

The hardest part of this project was trying to find fonts similar enough to the fonts Fireship uses. The fonts he uses are fonts that you can only get through [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/). I can't get Adobe Fonts on it's own. If I want to use Adobe Fonts, I have to get Adobe Creative Cloud, which is not something that I need.
