## My [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) solution to the [time tracking dashboard](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/time-tracking-dashboard-UIQ7167Jw) challenge

This project was a Junior level Frontend Mentor project. For thius project, I needed to import a json file with the times spent on each of the activities and show the right time based on whether you wanted to see the daily, weekly, or monthly times.

### What did I use?

I used [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) for this project. Vue is a versitile JavaScript framework originally meant as a lighter weight replacement for [Angular](https://angular.io/) for small development teams, but it has since evolved into it's own thing. Vue is a very popular framework, with more than 1 million weekly downloads on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/).

I decided to use Vue since I prefer how Vue handles separating the logic of a component from the rendering of a component. Vue has a specific template section for the HTML and a script section for the JavaScript. Vue, being a framework, has a more rigid code structure compared to React, which is a library. I prefer having more rules set by the framework so it's harder to write completely unreadable code.

### Will I use Vue again?

I really liked using Vue, but if I'm working on a project for myself, I will probably use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is like a easier Vue, or [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/), which is like a faster, easier React.
