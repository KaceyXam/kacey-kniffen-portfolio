## Tic Tac Toe with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)

With this project I decided to make the game Tic Tac Toe using the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev) JavaScript Framework in a single day.

### Why Svelte?

I decided to use Svelte because Svelte is a very simple framework, compared to things like [Angular]() and [React](). Since Svelte is a compiled framework, the actual code you write ends up being simpler since all the complexity of managing state can be handled by the compiler.

### Why Tic Tac Toe?

I decided to make Tic Tac Toe because it's a very simple game that everyone is familier with, so if I ran into any troubles, I could just look at other people's versions of the game. I wanted to see how much of this I could do without looking up anything though.

### Why a single day?

I wanted to build it in a single day because I thought the challenge would be fun. I also wanted to see how Svelte works for making simple games like this or Hangman.
